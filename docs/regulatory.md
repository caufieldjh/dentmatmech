# Regulatory status

The question this section answers for each material: *what is it approved for, and by whom?*

## How FDA regulates dental materials

FDA regulates dental materials as medical devices through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Dental devices are classified in [21 CFR part 872](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-872); restorative and prosthetic materials sit in subpart D, *Prosthetic Devices*. Each section (for example `872.3690`, tooth shade resin material) gives an *identification* paragraph describing the device type and its intended use, and a *classification* paragraph assigning a risk class.

- **Class I**: general controls. Often exempt from premarket notification.
- **Class II**: general and special controls. Usually reaches market through a 510(k) premarket notification showing substantial equivalence to a predicate; some class II dental materials are 510(k)-exempt subject to the limits of `872.9`.
- **Class III**: premarket approval (PMA).

Each regulation maps to one or more three-letter **product codes** in FDA's [Product Classification database](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm). A product code is what individual 510(k) records carry, so it is the join key between a device type and the products cleared under it.

## Two levels in the model

**`regulatory_status`** is the device-type level. One entry per agency and regulation:

```yaml
regulatory_status:
- agency: FDA
  status: CLEARED                    # what standing the device type has
  regulation_number: '872.3690'      # section of 21 CFR 872
  regulation_title: Tooth shade resin material
  device_class: CLASS_II
  product_codes: [EBF, OFW]
  pathways: [PREMARKET_NOTIFICATION_510K]
  special_controls: []               # guidance documents named in the regulation
  identification: >-                 # paragraph (a), quoted verbatim
    Tooth shade resin material is a device composed of materials such as
    bisphenol-A glycidyl methacrylate (Bis-GMA) intended to restore carious
    lesions or structural defects in teeth.
  approved_uses:                     # what the regulation permits
  - name: Restoration of carious lesions or structural defects in teeth
    use_context: DIRECT_RESTORATION
  restrictions: []                   # population or labeling limits
  source_url: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/section-872.3690
  evidence: []
```

**`products`** is the product level. A branded product and its submissions:

```yaml
products:
- name: Filtek Supreme Ultra
  manufacturer: 3M ESPE
  submissions:
  - agency: FDA
    submission_number: K093412
    pathway: PREMARKET_NOTIFICATION_510K
    decision: CLEARED
    decision_date: '2010-01-22'
    product_code: EBF
    regulation_number: '872.3690'
    indications_for_use: >-
      (quoted from the 510(k) summary)
    source_url: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K093412
```

The product example above is illustrative; check the record before curating it.

## Mapping OHD materials to FDA regulations

The two systems cut the world differently. OHD classifies by *what the material is*; FDA classifies by *what the device is for*. So one OHD material can fall under several regulations (a resin composite used as a core build-up, a luting cement, or a pit and fissure sealant), and one regulation can cover several OHD materials (`872.3275` dental cement spans glass ionomer, zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, and resin cements). Record one `regulatory_status` entry per applicable regulation, and use `approved_uses` to say which use each one governs.

Regulations verified against the CFR text and the FDA product classification database on 2026-09-04:

| Regulation | Device name | Class | Product codes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 872.3060 | Noble metal alloy | II (special controls) | EJS, EJT | 510(k)-exempt subject to 872.9 |
| 872.3070 | Dental amalgam, mercury, and amalgam alloy | II (special controls) | EJJ, ELY, OIV | Special controls guidance named in the regulation |
| 872.3200 | Resin tooth bonding agent | II | KLE | |
| 872.3250 | Calcium hydroxide cavity liner | II | | |
| 872.3275 | Dental cement | I (zinc oxide-eugenol, EMB, 510(k)-exempt); II (others, EMA) | EMA, EMB | |
| 872.3640 | Endosseous dental implant | II (special controls) | DZE, NRQ, OAT | Root-form and blade-form |
| 872.3690 | Tooth shade resin material | II | EBF, OFW | |
| 872.3710 | Base metal alloy | II (special controls) | EJH | 510(k)-exempt subject to 872.9 |
| 872.3920 | Porcelain tooth | II | ELL | |

### `regulation_title` is the device name, not the section heading

The schema defines `regulation_title` as the *device name as given in the classification regulation*. The two differ whenever one section classifies more than one device type, and then only the device name carries the class.

`872.3275` is the case in this KB. Its heading is `§ 872.3275 Dental cement.`, but it names two devices with two different classes:

| CFR paragraph | Device name as the regulation gives it | Class | Product code |
|---|---|---|---|
| `(a)` | Zinc oxide-eugenol | I (general controls), exempt subject to 872.9 | EMB |
| `(b)` | Dental cement other than zinc oxide-eugenol | II | EMA |

So an entry asserting `device_class: CLASS_II` under this regulation carries `regulation_title: Dental cement other than zinc oxide-eugenol`. Using the section heading would drop the distinction the class depends on. The table above has one row per section, so it prints the heading; material entries use the device name.

### Looking up a product code

Query by product code, not by regulation number:

```
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm?id=KLE
```

The `?id=<CODE>` form returns that one record and is reliable. The `?start_search=1&regulationnumber=NNNN` search form is often rate-limited, and it fails by returning an `Accessdata Error` page that reads like *no such regulation* rather than like throttling. The `results.cfm` search endpoint ignores its query parameters. All forms need a desktop browser `User-Agent`; without one FDA serves an apology page.

Verified against the CFR text and the product classification database on 2026-10-03: `KLE` -> 872.3200, class 2, 510(k), "agent, tooth bonding, resin"; `EMA` -> 872.3275, class 2, 510(k), "cement, dental"; `EMB` -> 872.3275, class 1, 510(k) exempt, "zinc oxide eugenol". The `872.3200` and `872.3275` rows above were re-confirmed the same day.

## Other regulators

`agency` also accepts EU MDR, Health Canada, MHRA, TGA, PMDA, NMPA, and ANVISA, with `device_class` values for the EU scheme (IIa, IIb). Nothing beyond FDA is curated yet; the slots exist so the model does not have to change when that happens.
