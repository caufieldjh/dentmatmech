# Regulatory status

The question this section answers for each material: *what is it approved for, and by whom?*

## How FDA regulates dental materials

FDA regulates dental materials as medical devices through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Dental devices are classified in [21 CFR part 872](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-872); restorative and prosthetic materials sit in subpart D, *Prosthetic Devices*. Each section (for example `872.3690`, tooth shade resin material) gives an *identification* paragraph describing the device type and its intended use, and a *classification* paragraph assigning a risk class.

- **Class I**: general controls. Often exempt from premarket notification.
- **Class II**: general and special controls. Usually reaches market through a 510(k) premarket notification showing substantial equivalence to a predicate; some class II dental materials are 510(k)-exempt subject to the limits of `872.9`.
- **Class III**: premarket approval (PMA).

Each regulation maps to one or more three-letter **product codes** in FDA's [Product Classification database](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm). A product code is what individual 510(k) records carry, so it is the join key between a device type and the products cleared under it.

## Two levels in the model

**`regulatory_status`** is the device-type level. One entry per agency and regulation:

```yaml
regulatory_status:
- agency: FDA
  status: CLEARED                    # what standing the device type has
  regulation_number: '872.3690'      # section of 21 CFR 872
  regulation_title: Tooth shade resin material
  device_class: CLASS_II
  product_codes: [EBF, OFW]
  pathways: [PREMARKET_NOTIFICATION_510K]
  special_controls: []               # guidance documents named in the regulation
  identification: >-                 # paragraph (a), quoted verbatim
    Tooth shade resin material is a device composed of materials such as
    bisphenol-A glycidyl methacrylate (Bis-GMA) intended to restore carious
    lesions or structural defects in teeth.
  approved_uses:                     # what the regulation permits
  - name: Restoration of carious lesions or structural defects in teeth
    use_context: DIRECT_RESTORATION
  restrictions: []                   # population or labeling limits
  source_url: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/section-872.3690
  evidence: []
```

**`products`** is the product level. A branded product and its submissions:

```yaml
products:
- name: Filtek Supreme Ultra
  manufacturer: 3M ESPE
  submissions:
  - agency: FDA
    submission_number: K093412
    pathway: PREMARKET_NOTIFICATION_510K
    decision: CLEARED
    decision_date: '2010-01-22'
    product_code: EBF
    regulation_number: '872.3690'
    indications_for_use: >-
      (quoted from the 510(k) summary)
    source_url: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K093412
```

The product example above is illustrative; check the record before curating it.

## Mapping OHD materials to FDA regulations

The two systems cut the world differently. OHD classifies by *what the material is*; FDA classifies by *what the device is for*. So one OHD material can fall under several regulations (a resin composite used as a core build-up, a luting cement, or a pit and fissure sealant), and one regulation can cover several OHD materials (`872.3275` dental cement spans glass ionomer, zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, and resin cements). Record one `regulatory_status` entry per applicable regulation, and use `approved_uses` to say which use each one governs.

Regulations verified against the CFR text and the FDA product classification database on 2026-09-04:

| Regulation | Device name | Class | Product codes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 872.3060 | Noble metal alloy | II (special controls) | EJS, EJT | 510(k)-exempt subject to 872.9. The database also returns EIT (applicator, rapid wax, dental) under this regulation; it is a laboratory accessory, not an alloy |
| 872.3070 | Dental amalgam, mercury, and amalgam alloy | II (special controls) | EJJ, ELY, OIV | Special controls guidance named in the regulation |
| 872.3200 | Resin tooth bonding agent | II | | |
| 872.3250 | Calcium hydroxide cavity liner | II | | |
| 872.3275 | Dental cement | I (zinc oxide-eugenol, EMB, 510(k)-exempt); II (others, EMA) | EMA, EMB | |
| 872.3640 | Endosseous dental implant | II (special controls) | DZE, NRQ, OAT | Root-form and blade-form |
| 872.3690 | Tooth shade resin material | II | EBF, OFW | |
| 872.3710 | Base metal alloy | II (special controls) | EJH | 510(k)-exempt subject to 872.9 |
| 872.3920 | Porcelain tooth | II | ELL | |

872.3060, 872.3070, and 872.3710 were re-verified from the same two primary sources on 2026-09-06 while curating `Metal`. The regulation titles, identification paragraphs, classes, and product codes were unchanged. Submission type in the classification database is `510(K) Exempt` for EJS, EJT, and EJH, and `510(k)` for EJJ, ELY, and OIV.

## A note on `872.9` exemptions

Some device types are class II *and* 510(k)-exempt — `872.3060` and `872.3710` both are. That combination is easy to misread: the exemption is granted in the classification paragraph itself and is bounded by `872.9`, which withdraws it when a device has a new intended use or operates on a different fundamental scientific technology. Record such a device type as `status: EXEMPT` with `pathways: [EXEMPT_510K]`, not as `CLEARED`. `872.3070` sits next to them as the counterexample: same class, same special-controls pattern, no exemption.

## Standards recognition

FDA's [Recognized Consensus Standards database](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm) is where to verify a standard's current edition before recording it. Its per-standard page also lists the regulations and product codes the standard applies to, which makes it a useful independent check on a product code you have already looked up in the classification database. The search form posts to `results.cfm`; the citable per-standard URL is `detail.cfm?standard__identification_no=NNNNN`.

Recognitions verified on 2026-09-08 while curating `Metal`:

| Standard | Edition | Recognition number | Extent | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ISO 22674 | Third edition 2022-08 | 4-300 | Complete | 872.3060 (EJS, EJT), 872.3710 (EJH) |
| ISO 9693 | Third edition 2019-10 | 4-263 | Complete | 872.3060, 872.3710, 872.3920, 872.6660 |
| ISO 24234 | Third edition 2021-08 | 4-315 | Complete | 872.3070 (EJJ, ELY) |

ISO 22674 excludes amalgam alloys by its own scope, which is why a metal entry needs ISO 24234 alongside it.

## Other regulators

`agency` also accepts EU MDR, Health Canada, MHRA, TGA, PMDA, NMPA, and ANVISA, with `device_class` values for the EU scheme (IIa, IIb). Nothing beyond FDA is curated yet; the slots exist so the model does not have to change when that happens.
