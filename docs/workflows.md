# Automation

The repository runs a small curation loop on GitHub Actions, cut down from
DisMech's. Each workflow does one thing.

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `main.yaml` | push, PR | Lint, schema generation, whole-KB validation, tests, render check |
| `deploy-docs.yaml` | push to main | Renders pages and the browser, builds mkdocs, deploys to GitHub Pages |
| `generate-pages.yaml` | push to main touching `kb/` or the renderer | Re-renders `pages/` and `app/data.js` and commits them |
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` in an issue, comment, or review by a collaborator | General-purpose agent with repo access |
| `claude-code-review.yml` | PR touching `kb/`, schema, or cache | Reviews with the `dentmatmech-pr-review` skill and approves or requests changes |
| `claude-issue-triage.yml` | issue opened | Labels the issue and posts an assessment |
| `curation-scanner.yml` | every 6 hours, or by hand | Picks one `curation` issue or stalled PR and advances it; files a new issue when the queue is empty |

## Secrets

| Secret | Needed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | all Claude workflows | From `claude setup-token`. Subscription-billed, subject to the weekly usage cap. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | all Claude workflows (optional) | When set it is preferred over the OAuth token; pay-per-use, no cap. |
| `EDISON_API_KEY` or `FUTUREHOUSE_API_KEY` | `falcon` research provider | Optional. Same key under either name. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai` research provider | Optional. |

Set one with:

```bash
gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --repo caufieldjh/dentmatmech
```

The `claude_code` research provider needs no extra secret. It reuses the
Claude Code credential the workflow already has, which is why it is the
scanner's default.

## The curation loop

1. Someone opens a **Curate a material** issue (template provided), or the scanner files one for the next stub.
2. Triage labels it `curation`.
3. The scanner picks it up, runs `just research-material`, fills the entry following the `curate-material` skill, verifies regulatory facts against the CFR and FDA database, validates, and opens a draft PR.
4. The review workflow checks the PR and approves or requests changes.
5. The scanner tends stalled PRs on later runs.
6. A human merges. The pages workflow re-renders; the deploy workflow publishes.

## Running the pieces by hand

```bash
just research-material claude_code Glass_Ionomer_Cement
just research-material falcon Glass_Ionomer_Cement
just research-status
just validate-research-reference research/Glass_Ionomer_Cement-deep-research-falcon.md
just fetch-reference PMID:27367737
```

In Claude Code, `/curate Glass_Ionomer_Cement using falcon` runs the whole
skill.

## Model choice

Each workflow sets `AGENT_MODEL` at the top of its file. The scanner and the
review use `claude-opus-5`; triage uses `claude-sonnet-5`. The scanner's
manual trigger accepts a model override.

## Deliberately left out of DisMech's set

PR shepherd, literature and preprint scans, knowledge-gap scans, discussion
scanning, the GitHub App writer and reviewer identities, and the central
agent-config resolver. Add them back when the queue justifies them.
